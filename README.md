# Divvy Dashboard

## Project Overview

I set out to identify the popularity of the Chicago bike-sharing service Divvy and how weather impacts rides. I used Divvy trip history data and the OpenWeather API.

The research questions guiding the project were:

- Where are all the Divvy bike stations by neighborhood, community area, and ward?
- What is the ride count of each Divvy station?
- How does the total count of Divvy rides vary by month?
- Which season has the most and/or least Divvy rides?
- How does precipitation impact the average daily rides?
